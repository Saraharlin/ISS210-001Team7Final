Gender equality in general has been a long going fight. While the United States have come far in progressing towards gender equality, our past limits us. Since women in the U.S have only been legally allowed to work in just the last century, there are still many unresolved issues making the workplace an unfair, and sometimes, unsafe place for women. Many people hold biases against women resulting in unfortunate events such as unequal pay and sexual harrassment. Because of our patriarchal society, the workplace is also a patriarchal place. Women are often not the first to be considered since they are the minority. This makes women more prone to suffer many inequalities. To learn more, read below and also see what you can do to help the cause to fight for gender equality in the workforce. </p>

                <div class="container"><p> Women in the workplace are still being treated unequally.To this day women in the workplace still are treated differently as if they are not worth the same as a man. Women are still being paid less and many companies are male dominated. Working in some industries, women are not taken seriously and have to take an extra step to show or prove they are just as valuable as men. Every person deserves to be treated equally no matter their identity.  Whether a person is identified as male or female and has the same skills and intelligence, they should be given the ability to pursue their expertise as it is just as useful and important. Companies have already taken action addressing this issue. The Treehouse Foods company is a packaging company that designs packages for private labeling for foods and beverages for retail grocery. Speaking with two professionals from the company that are both female have stated that they still see inequality between genders. That being said, their company has taken action and hosted a wide leadership meeting surrounding women giving them recognition. However, there are still many times that females are still being treated unequally meaning there is still much more room for improvement. Companies should look more into hosting wide leadership meetings and have groups and organizations so there are safe spaces to go to. </p>

                                    <p class="mb-4">The glass ceiling is something affecting many women and minority groups all around the world today. The glass ceiling by definition is a barrier to advancement in a profession or career affecting minority groups. There are laws against discrimination along with recent efforts to promote diversity. However, according to Babic and Hansez, members of Human Resources Development Unit at University of Liege in Belgium state that women still remain the minority in decision-making positions. "In 2018, women occupied 16% of postions on the executive committees of large Belgian companies". They also state that women feel they recieve different treatment (Babic and Hansez). In order to change, we must continue to educate others, use our voices, expose wrongful treatment, and continue to vote for legislative change to protect women's rights in the work place. </p>

                                    <p class="mb-4">The video above, "Sexual Harrassment in the Workplace", defines workplace sexual harrassment as,"Unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature constitutes sexual harassment when submission to or rejection of this conduct explicitly or implicitly affects an individual’s employment, unreasonably interferes with an individual’s work performance or creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment". While affecting men at a reported 43%, 81% of women have experienced a form of sexual harrassment in the workplace. There are forms of "hostile" and "quid pro quo" sexual harrassment further described in the video. This is something that women deal with very frequently in the workplace, and is often overlooked. Organizations are notorious for dealing with reportings of sexual harrassment fairly terribly. Because of this unfortunate truth, according to U.S Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, "...One study cited in the report found that 90% of individuals who say they have experienced harassment never take formal action against the harassment, such as filing a charge or a complaint" (Sexual Harrassment in Our Nation's Workplace 3). An important thing to note is there are things you can do to help. In order to prevent cases of sexual harrassment, help the victim, educate others on what sexual harrassment can look like, and call-out unprofessional and demeaning behaviors of others and businesses themselves.  </p>

She touches on many inequalities which women face in the workplace. She explains that pay between men and women are not equal. Furthermore,  Freedman says that women are offered lower starting salaries than men. Not only does she talk about inequalities of pay but she also talks about what it feels like to be a woman in the workplace. Being a woman increases likelihood of vulnerability to sexual harassment. Sexual harassment is not just inappropriate touching, but also unwanted jokes and unwelcomed advances. She explains, that this occurs because of the way society perceives women today and throughout history..</p>

                                    <p class="mb-4"> 	In order to properly assess the discrimination women face in the workplace, it is necessary to assess the prioritization and communication about these issues by employers and the strategies that have proven most effective at raising awareness of these issues. Organized discussion on this topic is often scarce and less problem-solving focused than many other workplace anti-discrimination processes. This is probably due to the multiple levels at which gender based work discrimination functions, of which there are both coworker to coworker infringements as well as company policy/systemwide discriminations. 
	The easiest way to work towards the eradication of gender-based coworker discrimination is through company initiatives to empower the individual to avoid a lack of identification of these micro/macroaggressions. Jo-Yun Li of the University of Miami finds in his study “The role of strategic internal communication in empowering female employees to cope with workplace gender discrimination” that “Perceived powerlessness and a sense of lacking control to change the situation then lead to a more passive coping approach that focuses on dealing with the subsequent emotions without altering the meaning of the event directly”(Li 6). By increasing easy-access resources within the company and access to resources outside of it, perceived powerlessness can be slowly eradicated from the female workspace.
	Company wide discrimination such as salary gaps and hiring discrimination is a much harder issue to phase out, and many different methods have been pitted against these issues to varying levels of success. Particularly, Li finds that the association of public relations work has some of the largest perceptions of gender pay gaps and disvalue of women. The study finds that most effectively, involving predominantly oppressed parties in specific anti-discrimination groups within the company allows for greater swinging power on these issues as well as a larger platform from within for their voices to be heard.

Activism has had a place in the myriad struggles of workplace equality, such as comparable worth, or equal pay. Empowerment strategies are inextricably interwoven with activism, and integrating the action into one’s personal power is an invaluable part of that fight. Specifically, the article spends a lot of time talking about CSA/925, and uses them as an example of political influence through activism, that their accomplishments are living proof of active empowerment...</p>

It's important to be an advocate for gender equality and stand up for the rights of oppressed women. If you find yourself in a conversation where you witness or experience any form of misogyny, it's important to speak up and defend the rights of women. 
Support one another
Empowering women not only uplifts them but also sets us on the right path to gender equality. By lifting up other women and offering support and encouragement, we create a community of strength and resilience.

Share the workload
Research has shown that the majority of unpaid domestic work in households is carried out by women. In fact, women are known to do as much as 2.6 times the unpaid domestic work compared to men. Sharing the domestic workload, however, can bring about numerous benefits for both men and women. 

Get involved
Running for positions that support and aid women or supporting women candidates can inspire more women to follow suit and work towards creating a better world for everyone. This creates a more inclusive and diverse representation in leadership positions. When women have a voice at the table, policies and decisions are made with a greater understanding of the issues and challenges that women face. 

Educate the next generation
Empowering children with this knowledge and education is a critical step toward creating a better and more equal future. By doing so, we can create a generation of young people who are actively fighting for what's right and just, and who are committed to promoting gender equality in every form.
